# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs via Predictive Modeling of Congestion

**Overview:**

This project aims to reduce last-mile delivery expenses by 15% within six months.  We achieve this by developing and implementing a predictive model that identifies and mitigates traffic congestion hotspots. The analysis leverages historical delivery data to predict congestion patterns and inform optimized routing decisions, ultimately leading to cost savings.  The model incorporates various factors influencing delivery times, such as time of day, day of the week, and geographical location.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Model:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key metrics such as model accuracy and predicted cost savings.  Additionally, the following visualizations will be generated in the `output` directory:

* `congestion_map.png`: A geographical visualization of predicted congestion hotspots.
* `cost_savings_projection.png`: A plot projecting the expected cost savings over time.
* (Add any other output files generated here)
